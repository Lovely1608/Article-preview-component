## My process
## My Process

**What does this function do?**  
It hides the "Share" link by default and opacity it only when the "Share" icon is clicked.

**Why did I write it?**  
This was implemented to fulfill the projectâ€™s interactivity requirements and to provide a smoother user experience.

**How does it work?**  
When the user clicks the "Share" icon, the "Share" link appears, allowing access to multiple social media sharing options with a single click.

**What problem does it solve?**  
It offers users a quick and convenient way to share content on different social platforms, improving accessibility and usability.
